# Weather App TODO List

## High Priority
1. Add Tomorrow's Forecast Screen
   - Create a new screen component for tomorrow's forecast
   - Implement navigation between current weather and forecast screens
   - Fetch and display tomorrow's weather data from the API

2. Add Start Hunt and End Hunt Times
   - Research optimal hunting times based on weather conditions
   - Add new fields to display start and end hunt times
   - Implement logic to calculate these times based on weather data

3. Implement Refresh Functionality
   - Add a refresh button or pull-to-refresh mechanism
   - Display last refreshed timestamp
   - Implement the refresh logic to fetch new weather data

4. Dynamic Background Based on Weather
   - Create a collection of background images for different weather conditions
   - Implement logic to select the appropriate background based on current weather
   - Ensure smooth transitions between background changes

## Medium Priority
5. Improve Error Handling
   - Implement more robust error handling for API calls
   - Create user-friendly error messages
   - Add retry mechanism for failed API calls

6. Add Settings Screen
   - Create a settings screen for user preferences
   - Allow users to switch between imperial and metric units
   - Option to change location

7. Implement Local Storage
   - Cache weather data locally to reduce API calls
   - Implement logic to use cached data when offline

## Low Priority
8. Enhance UI/UX
   - Add animations for weather condition changes
   - Improve accessibility features (e.g., larger text options, high contrast mode)
   - Implement dark mode

9. Add Weather Alerts
   - Integrate severe weather alerts from the API
   - Implement push notifications for weather alerts

10. Expand Forecast Range
    - Add options for 5-day and 7-day forecasts
    - Create a scrollable/swipeable forecast view

## Future Considerations
- Integrate with other APIs (e.g., hunting season dates, local regulations)
- Add social features (e.g., share weather conditions, hunting plans)
- Create a companion widget for quick weather updates on the home screen
